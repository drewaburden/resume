Résumé

This project is meant to be a quick and simple demonstration of some of my abilities in the form of a game, with the added bonus that it's not super boring to read (like a normal résumé). The game is in the style of old, 2D DOS-era games. I really love old games, and I always wanted to make something that could serve as a tribute to the games from that era, and I knew I wanted to make a less-than-conventional résumé. So, this is my fusion of those two concepts.

Doing this project was also somewhat of an exercise for me. I wanted to understand more about the other aspects of game creation besides programming. In order to better communicate and ultimately work much better as a team, I think it's important to understand what it's like to be in a coworker's position. I believe that this project demonstrates this understanding; therefore, I think this makes me an excellent candidate for a programming position.
