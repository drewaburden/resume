<a name="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h2>

<p>This project is meant to be a quick and simple demonstration of some of my abilities in the form of a game, with the added bonus that it's not super boring to read (like a normal résumé).
The game is in the style of old, 2D DOS-era games. I really love old games, and I always wanted to make something that could serve as a tribute to the games from that era, and I knew I wanted to make a less-than-conventional résumé. So, this is my fusion of those two concepts.</p>

<p>Doing this project was also somewhat of an exercise for me. I wanted to understand more about the other aspects of game creation besides programming. In order to better communicate and ultimately work much better as a team, I think it's important to understand what it's like to be in a coworker's position. I believe that this project demonstrates this understanding; therefore, I think this makes me an excellent candidate for a programming position.</p>

<a name="my-other-projects" class="anchor" href="#my-other-projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My other projects</h2>

<p>This project demonstrates my understanding of the other facets of game design and development, and it shows that I can work independently. However, in a real-world situation, I am not going to be developing by myself. So what about projects that I've collaborated on?</p>

<p>I've had two major projects that I've collaborated on:</p>

<ol>
<li>Disaster-response training simulator for Android (commissioned by Y-12 National Security Complex)</li>
<li>
<a href="http://drewaburden.github.io/Cat-apps/">Cat-Apps</a> (Senior design project)</li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="cat-apps" class="anchor" href="#cat-apps"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cat-Apps</h3>

<p><a href="http://drewaburden.github.io/Cat-apps/">Cat-Apps</a> is a prototype Android game about cats that I worked on with three other students for our 4-month senior design project. I served as co-project lead. The intention was to continue working on the project after our senior design class ended, but the project drew attention from a professor who then hired us to develop the project commissioned by Y-12.<br>A demonstration of Cat-Apps can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnv9qzuTafs">here</a>, and a much more fun/embarrassing video can be provided upon request.</p>

<a name="training-simulator-for-y-12-national-security-complex" class="anchor" href="#training-simulator-for-y-12-national-security-complex"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Training simulator for Y-12 National Security Complex</h3>

<p>I'm not allowed to say very much about the project itself. We were commissioned by Y-12 to develop a mobile training simulator to assist in disaster-response training. The work was heavily collaborative, with the number of people on our team peaking at about 15 people divided into three different departments: development, art, and consultants. My role was lead developer, and everyone in the development department also contributed equally to the design. The work on the project is on-going. However, due to my current job-searching, I've resigned from development lead, and I am now serving as a design and development consultant for the project.</p>
