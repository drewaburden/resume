 * Description:
 *      This project is meant to be a quick and simple demonstration of some of my abilities in the
 *      form of a game, with the added bonus that it's not super boring to read (like a normal résumé).
 *      The game is in the style of old, 2D DOS-era games. I really love old games, and I always wanted
 *      to make something that could serve as a tribute to the games from that era, and I knew I wanted
 *      to make a less-than-conventional résumé. So, this is my fusion of those two concepts.
 *
 *      Doing this project was also somewhat of an exercise for me. I wanted to understand more about
 *      the other aspects of game creation besides programming. In order to better communicate and
 *      ultimately work much better as a team, I think it's important to understand what it's like to be
 *      in a coworker's position. I believe that this project demonstrates this understanding; therefore,
 *      I think this makes me an excellent candidate for a programming position.
 *
 *      Note: Just about everything in this application (strings, sprites, animations, settings, etc.)
 *      is hard-coded, just for the sake of saving time. In a real world situation and for work I've done
 *      in the past, I would have coded a subsystem for dynamically loading all of this information from
 *      files (typically XML).
 *      Also, I've given myself a deadline on this project, so some things are going to be a bit rushed.
 *      As a side effect, some things may not be implemented in the best way. While I could've sat
 *      around for days or even weeks and thought through every aspect of the implementation in order to
 *      get the best implementations possible, when you're short on time, you have to know when to stop
 *      the planning and just dive into it.
 *
 *      This class defines the entry-point for the desktop LibGDX application.
