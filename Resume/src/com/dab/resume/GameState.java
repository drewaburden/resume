 *      Defines and handles overall states of the game that may or may not affect the flow of the game.
 *      This class also provides helper methods that allow us to set multiple states at one time.
 *      It's up to the user of the class to decide what states should and should not be set at the same
 *      time, and it is that user's responsibility to enforce that.
