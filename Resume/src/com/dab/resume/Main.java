 * Project:     Resume
 * File:        Main.java

 * Description:
 *      This application is a fun little all-in-one resume/cover letter/references info/demonstration
 *      intended to reduce some of the blandness associated with looking through resumes and cover
 *      letters.
 *      Note: Just about everything in this application (strings, sprites, animations, settings, etc.)
 *      is hard-coded, just for the sake of time. In a real world situation and for work I've done in
 *      the past, I would have coded a subsystem for dynamically loading all of this information from
 *      files, typically XML.
 *      Also, I've given myself a deadline on this project, so some things are going to be a bit rushed.
 *      As a side effect, some things may not be implemented in the best way. While I could've sat
 *      around for days or even weeks and thought through every aspect of the implementation in order to
 *      get the best implementations possible, when you're short on time, you have to know when to stop
 *      the planning and just dive into it.
 *
 *      This class defines the entry-point for the desktop LibGDX application.
