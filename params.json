{"name":"Résumé","tagline":"Drew Burden's sort-of-résumé thing","body":"## What is it?\r\nThis project is meant to be a quick and simple demonstration of some of my abilities in the form of a game, with the added bonus that it's not super boring to read (like a normal résumé).\r\nThe game is in the style of old, 2D DOS-era games. I really love old games, and I always wanted to make something that could serve as a tribute to the games from that era, and I knew I wanted to make a less-than-conventional résumé. So, this is my fusion of those two concepts.\r\n\r\nDoing this project was also somewhat of an exercise for me. I wanted to understand more about the other aspects of game creation besides programming. In order to better communicate and ultimately work much better as a team, I think it's important to understand what it's like to be in a coworker's position. I believe that this project demonstrates this understanding; therefore, I think this makes me an excellent candidate for a programming position.\r\n\r\n## My other projects\r\nThis project demonstrates my understanding of the other facets of game design and development, and it shows that I can work independently. However, in a real-world situation, I am not going to be developing by myself. So what about projects that I've collaborated on?\r\n\r\nI've had two major projects that I've collaborated on:\r\n\r\n1. Disaster-response training simulator for Android (commissioned by Y-12 National Security Complex)\r\n2. [Cat-Apps](http://drewaburden.github.io/Cat-apps/) (Senior design project)\r\n\r\n### Cat-Apps\r\n[Cat-Apps](http://drewaburden.github.io/Cat-apps/) is a prototype Android game about cats that I worked on with three other students for our 4-month senior design project. I served as co-project lead. The intention was to continue working on the project after our senior design class ended, but the project drew attention from a professor who then hired us to develop the project commissioned by Y-12.<br>A demonstration of Cat-Apps can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnv9qzuTafs), and a much more fun/embarrassing video can be provided upon request.\r\n\r\n### Training simulator for Y-12 National Security Complex\r\nI'm not allowed to say very much about the project itself. We were commissioned by Y-12 to develop a mobile training simulator to assist in disaster-response training. The work was heavily collaborative, with the number of people on our team peaking at about 15 people divided into three different departments: development, art, and consultants. My role was lead developer, and everyone in the development department also contributed equally to the design. The work on the project is on-going. However, due to my current job-searching, I've resigned from development lead, and I am now serving as a design and development consultant for the project.","google":"UA-10304442-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
